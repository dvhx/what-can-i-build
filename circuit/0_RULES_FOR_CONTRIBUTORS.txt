- one circuit per json file
- filename can only contain lowercase character, number or underscore
- once you publish filename, don't change the filename, change the "name" or "author" field instead
- circuit names should be unique, e.g. "Bazz Fuss", "Bazz Fuss v2", "Bazz Fuss (Germanium)", having "Booster" from multiple authors is OK
- all parts must have name and value ("R1": "10k", "R2": "4k7", ...)
- parts names prefixes
    R   resistor
    P   potentiometer
    PT  trimmer pot
    C   capacitor
    L   inductor
    D   diode
    T   transistor
    Q   chip, voltage regulator
    J   connector
    S   switch
    LDR ldr
    V   tube
    U   supply or battery
    X   other
- values
    - use 1k2 not 1.2k, 4u7 not 4.7u, 2M2 not 2.2M
    - without unit (100n not 100nF, 22k not 22kâ„¦)
    - model names are upper case (1N34 not 1n34, 2N2222 not 2n2222)
- there must be at least 1 url
- dual pots are e.g. "50k Stereo"
- alternatives are array: ["BC547B", "BC547"] or ["BC547B", "BC547", "NPN"]
- any opamp is e.g. ["TL071", "Opamp Single"] or ["TL072", "NE5532", "Opamp Dual"]
- after you make changes or add new circuit, run 0_update.sh to generate circuits.js
